Migralite is lightweight forward-only SQLite migration tool for Bun.

Key features:

* Simple *.sql files
* Forward-only migrations [^1]
* Runs on Bun
* Sensible defaults, so there's no need to implement migration script (but you can if you want)
* Migration generator
* Version tracking â€” keeps track of applied migrations to prevent duplicate runs
* Migrations are wrapped in transactions by default
